# sysinfo.sh

BASH script that gathers system information and writes to terminal

Small script tested in a Debian VM - Should run in most 'nix' spins

Pieced together over time - may be of some use 

Warning - please DO NOT run foreign BASH scripts you do not fully understand and trust.

Script is PROVIDED "AS IS" and is for educational purposes only


Usage:

D/L the raw sysinfo.sh file into a working directory of your choice - wget, curl .etc

I drop mine into a BASH dir I set aside for .sh files

Once acquired, $chmod +x sysinfo.sh in order to change the file permissons to executable

To run script from CLI in your terminal emulator: $./sysinfo.sh or alternatively $bash sysinfo.sh 

Have fun editing and customizing it for your needs while learning more about BASH scripting

I drop mine into an alias within .bashrc - example: alias=sys'bash your_working_directory/file_path/sysinfo.sh'
